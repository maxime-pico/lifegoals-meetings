<h1>Pico Analysis:</h1>

<i>This analysis should be done ahead of meetings so that we can go through it in an efficient way during the meetings. Keep in mind that the goal is to give other participants a chance to help you AND to help them by sharing actionable learnings</i>

<h2>What is the current status?</h2>
<h3><i> Objectively update the current level of completion of your objectives </i></h3>
example: so far I have met x people out of my yearly goal of y

<h2>How are things trending?</h2>
<h3><i> Assess your current mood and tell about something you're proud of</i></h3>
example: I'm feeling awesome at the moment because I've accomplished my goal of running a marathon just 1 week ago

<h2>What are the recent successes? </h2>
<h3><i> Share a learning from something you've tried and that worked well</i></h3>
example: I tried anchoring my habits in a chain of habits starting with something as simple as drinking every morning when I wake up. It seems that thanks to that I accomplish other really cool stuff!

<h2>What are the recent failures?</h2>
<h3><i> Share a learning from something you've tried and that did not work</i></h3>
example: I tried compartimenting my weeks between days where I work to earn money and days where I learn. It has been a huge failure because customers call me on the "learning days" and I can't help but take the phone and start working again...

<h2>What are the current roadblocks?</h2>
<h3><i> What is in your way right now?</i></h3>
example: I think my biggest problem at the moment is that I don't sleep enough and that has big consequences on my motivation which in turn prevents me from acheiving my goals.

<h2>What are your objectives for next time?</h2>
<h3><i> What do you hope to have accomplish by next meeting?</i></h3>
example: I want to contact n more people
